This is a simple video-chat(conference) application
use WebRTC with peerjs to establish a peer-to-peer connection

description::
- in the main directory (...../simple_video) run "npm run dev-start" to launch the signaling server on localhost:3000
- also in the main directory (...../simple_video) run "peerjs --port 3001" to launch the peerjs server on localhost:3001 for generating userId
- accessing the main page (localhost:3000) will redirect user to a new chat room localhost:3000/{random url}
    for example http://localhost:3000/42fd1f15-bbda-437f-a684-893d5a1d4a76
- a new access to the previously generated "room" will append the new user video to the "room" page
- whenever someone leave the "room", his video will be removed
