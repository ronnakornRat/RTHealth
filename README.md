## Some user stories
Mr. A is a patient with a major depression. He is undergoing a psychotherapy. However, he is living along and is at risk. With RTHealth, he can talk to his therapists without physically traveling to the clinic.
Note: mental problems can be abrupt sometimes and it helps when thereâ€™s an actual person listening to your problem
###
Mrs. B, a docter, is currently treating a patient whose symptoms is very difficult to diagnose. She tried the treatment that has the highest chance of curing the symptoms but she would need a quick follow-ups on her patients, in case the administered treatment went wrong. With WebRTC, she can talk to her patient for a quick follow-up.
