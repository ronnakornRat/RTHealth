This is a simple video-chat(one-to-one) application
use WebRTC WITHOUT peerjs to establish a peer-to-peer connection

description::
- in the main directory (...../pair_video) run "npm run dev-start" to launch the signaling server on local
- accessing the main page (localhost:8080) will query a name for "chatroom"
- once the name is accepted, a chat room will open with local video
- open another tab at localhost:8080 and input the same "chatroom" name will connect to the previous "user"
- if another user (opening another tab), try to connect to the same room, the connection will not happen (room size is limited to 2)
